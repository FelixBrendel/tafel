- rapi name: "rapi"
- as root necessary (because tafel needs to run as root): git config --global --add safe.directory <path>/tafel

- autoupdate is run as root so maybe the premissions are messed up by the git commands it runs. to restore them run: sudo chown -R <actual>:wheel .

- the executable ./tafel when has to be run as sudo

- the DB_CLENT_ID and DB_CLENT_SECRET environment variables must be set (even when run as sudo, so maybe run as sudo -E)

manual full update: sudo chown -R felixb:wheel . && git pull && git reset --hard && ./build.sh && sudo ./tafel
